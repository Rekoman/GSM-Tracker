- Make the connections as discussed and upload the code to your Arduino Nano board. 
Insert the SIM card and make sure your network signal is established. 
One way to do this by monitoring the LED on your GSM module, which should flash once in every 3 seconds.
Now open the serial monitor and it should be working fine.

- Now that we have our latitude and longitude value we just have to attach it to our Link
 with a comma in-between to form the Link. The code for the same is given below.
code: Serial.println(Latitude); Serial.println(Longitude);
  Link = Link + Latitude + "," + Longitude;
- We will use the prepare_message() function to trim the value of latitude and longitude.
 As you can see in the below sample message
Response: [+CIPGSMLOC: 0,75.802460,26.848892,2019/04/23,08:32:35]

- Finally we can send the Link as SMS to a mobile number.
Here I have hardcoded the mobile number with the command AT+CMGS="907923XXXX", 
make sure you replace the command with your phone number.

- You can simply call to your GSM SIM number from any number 
and you will notice the call getting hanged up after first few rings 
and you will get a message to number which you have entered in the program.
 The text message will be contain the Google map link.
