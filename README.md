# GSM-Tracker
The project intends to track large birds using the cell phone network. Arduino Nano + Sim800l  +  PowerFilm SP4.2-37 + LiPo battery + TP4056. Using AT commands I can get location when network is available. The idea is sending the location as a text message every hour while network and energy available.
