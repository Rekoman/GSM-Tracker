- We have used the LM2596 Buck regulator IC to provide 4V to the SIM800 module from the input 12V. 
The SIM800 module requires around 2A peak current when initialized and searching for network, 
hence the power supply should be able to source that current, else the module will enter shutdown mode, 
and hence the LM2596 IC is selected which can supply upto 3A.

- The SIM800 GSM modem is commonly available as modem, 
but we have used the bare IC package to reduce board space and cost. 
Using the SIM800 modem is pretty much straight forward, 
we simply have to power the IC though the VBAT and GND pins
and then use the PWR KEY pin to enable the modem by pulling the pin down for 1 second.
By default the pin is pulled high internally to VBAT through a resistor.

- On the Microcontroller side we have the ATMEGA328P chip form AVR, 
which is the one used in Arduino UNO/Nano, 
but here the controller is embedded directly on the board to communicate with the SIM800 module. 
Since the SIM800 module operates in 3.3V logic, 
I decided to operate the ATmega328 chip 
also with 3.3V itself since it also supports both 3.3V and 5V operating voltages.
